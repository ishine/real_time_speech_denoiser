# The following are dictionaries of all the readers, writers, and processors that are native to this library. It is
# easily possible to create other readers, writer, and processors, both inside of this library and in the code of a
# user of this library. To create additional readers, writers and processors inside this library, simply add the object
# to the correct list below in the same manner as the other objects that are in the list currently. To create
# additional objects outside of this library, do not add the object to these dictionaries, and instead use the
# functionality that is exported in the Runner object in order to use different objects.
# Each of the dictionaries here is made out of a key for each class (the key that will need to appear in the object
# list in order to create the corresponding class), and its value, which is a lambda function that imports the class
# and returns it.
# The reason I chose to put a function that imports the class and returns it instead of importing all the classes and
# only putting in the dict the class itself, is that the importing of some classes can be quite heavy, and is not
# needed if the object is not one of the objects needed to be created as detailed in the object list.
